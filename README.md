A **Streamlit** web app for predicting **Diabetes**, **Heart Disease**, and **Parkinson's Disease** using machine learning models.  
This tool allows users to input medical parameters and receive disease prediction results instantly.

---

## Features

- Predict Diabetes based on clinical features like glucose, BMI, age, etc.
- Predict Heart Disease using standard cardiovascular health metrics.
- Predict Parkinson's Disease from vocal and speech signal features.
- Interactive and user-friendly UI built with Streamlit.
- Uses pre-trained models saved with pickle.

## Demo (Localhost)

To run the app locally and access the web interface, use this URL in your browser after starting the Streamlit app:

[http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)
